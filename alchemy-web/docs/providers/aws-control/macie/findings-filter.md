# FindingsFilter

The FindingsFilter resource allows you to manage [AWS Macie FindingsFilters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/userguide/) to control the findings generated by AWS Macie based on specific criteria.

## Minimal Example

Create a basic FindingsFilter with required properties and a common optional property.

```ts
import AWS from "alchemy/aws/control";

const BasicFindingsFilter = await AWS.Macie.FindingsFilter("BasicFindingsFilter", {
  Name: "SensitiveDataFilter",
  FindingCriteria: {
    Criterion: {
      "severity": { 
        "eq": ["HIGH"] 
      }
    }
  },
  Action: "ARCHIVE"
});
```

## Advanced Configuration

Configure a FindingsFilter with additional properties, such as a description and tags.

```ts
const AdvancedFindingsFilter = await AWS.Macie.FindingsFilter("AdvancedFindingsFilter", {
  Name: "SensitiveDataFilterWithTags",
  Description: "Filters findings based on high severity.",
  FindingCriteria: {
    Criterion: {
      "severity": {
        "eq": ["HIGH"]
      },
      "resourceType": {
        "eq": ["S3_OBJECT"]
      }
    }
  },
  Action: "ARCHIVE",
  Position: 1,
  Tags: [
    { Key: "Environment", Value: "production" },
    { Key: "Team", Value: "Security" }
  ]
});
```

## Example with Adoption

Create a FindingsFilter with the option to adopt an existing resource instead of failing if it already exists.

```ts
const AdoptFindingsFilter = await AWS.Macie.FindingsFilter("AdoptFindingsFilter", {
  Name: "ExistingSensitiveDataFilter",
  FindingCriteria: {
    Criterion: {
      "severity": {
        "eq": ["MEDIUM", "HIGH"]
      }
    }
  },
  Action: "ARCHIVE",
  adopt: true
});
```
