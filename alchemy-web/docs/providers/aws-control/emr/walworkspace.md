# WALWorkspace

The WALWorkspace resource allows you to create and manage AWS EMR WALWorkspaces, which are essential for processing and analyzing vast amounts of data using Amazon EMR. For more information, refer to the [AWS EMR WALWorkspaces documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/userguide/).

## Minimal Example

Create a basic WALWorkspace with a name and tags.

```ts
import AWS from "alchemy/aws/control";

const basicWALWorkspace = await AWS.EMR.WALWorkspace("BasicWALWorkspace", {
  WALWorkspaceName: "MyFirstWALWorkspace",
  Tags: [
    { Key: "Environment", Value: "development" },
    { Key: "Owner", Value: "data-team" }
  ]
});
```

## Advanced Configuration

Configure a WALWorkspace with additional properties such as adoption of existing resources.

```ts
const advancedWALWorkspace = await AWS.EMR.WALWorkspace("AdvancedWALWorkspace", {
  WALWorkspaceName: "MyAdvancedWALWorkspace",
  Tags: [
    { Key: "Environment", Value: "production" },
    { Key: "Team", Value: "DataScience" }
  ],
  adopt: true // Adopt existing resource if it already exists
});
```

## Workspace with Custom Tags

Create a WALWorkspace with specific tags for better resource management and tracking.

```ts
const taggedWALWorkspace = await AWS.EMR.WALWorkspace("TaggedWALWorkspace", {
  WALWorkspaceName: "MyTaggedWALWorkspace",
  Tags: [
    { Key: "Project", Value: "DataMigration" },
    { Key: "CostCenter", Value: "CC101" }
  ]
});
```

## Creating Multiple Workspaces

Manage multiple WALWorkspaces in a single script for batch processing.

```ts
const devWALWorkspace = await AWS.EMR.WALWorkspace("DevWALWorkspace", {
  WALWorkspaceName: "DevelopmentWorkspace",
  Tags: [
    { Key: "Environment", Value: "development" },
    { Key: "Owner", Value: "dev-team" }
  ]
});

const prodWALWorkspace = await AWS.EMR.WALWorkspace("ProdWALWorkspace", {
  WALWorkspaceName: "ProductionWorkspace",
  Tags: [
    { Key: "Environment", Value: "production" },
    { Key: "Owner", Value: "prod-team" }
  ]
});
```
